**Project Process**

Data Collection
Financial and transactional data was collected in Excel format, including details such as transactions, loan amounts, EMI, branches, and dates.

Data Cleaning
The data was cleaned in Power Query by removing duplicates, handling missing values, correcting data types, and formatting date and numeric fields.

Data Transformation
Necessary columns were created and transformed, such as extracting month and year from dates, calculating totals, averages, and other required measures.

Data Modeling
Relationships between tables were established (if multiple tables were used) to ensure accurate analysis and reporting.

DAX Calculations
Key measures and KPIs were created using DAX, such as total transaction amount, average loan amount, credit/debit counts, and EMI analysis.

Dashboard Design
Interactive visuals like charts, cards, tables, and slicers were created to present insights clearly and effectively.

Analysis & Insights
The dashboard was analyzed to identify trends, patterns, and performance across branches, time periods, and transaction types.

Final Reporting
The completed Power BI dashboard provides actionable insights to support financial decision-making.

**Final Conclusion**
The Financial Performance and Transaction Analysis Dashboard developed using Power BI successfully transforms raw Excel data into meaningful and interactive visual insights. The dashboard provides a clear understanding of transaction trends, loan performance, EMI patterns, and branch-wise financial activities.
Through effective data cleaning, modeling, and visualization, the project enables quick identification of key financial metrics and performance indicators. The use of interactive filters and KPIs enhances decision-making by allowing users to analyze data across different time periods and categories. Overall, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of Power BI as a powerful tool for financial data analysis and supports data-driven business decisions.
